                    This application is based on a deck of cards created by the musician Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt. An individual card can be drawn randomly from the deck, providing a suggestion, phrase, or word that offers an alternative way to think about a problem. Other features include saving multiple cards in a layout to combine multiple strategies, and being able to save favorite strategies (persistant in localStorage) to review later when needed.

                    A common question from students learning web development for the first time is: "What should I learn next after this course?"  Usually, my answer is to learn React - and I clearly need to practice what I preach!  After getting the basics down with Scrimba's excellent <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact" target="_blank">Learn React</a> course, I wanted to build something from scratch to solidify what I learned.  
                </p>
                <p class="block-text">
                    I've used the Oblique Strategies deck with creative projects in the past, and creating an app version seemed fun and practical (they really are great at giving your brain a reboot). I wanted to create a simple design inspired by the deck, while adding some interesting features that would challenge me, like working with localStorage and adjustable frames.  But mostly, I wanted to work with React without a safety net, and this project had just the right amount of difficulty and fun.
                </p>

            <div class="grid--block">
                <h2 class="block-title">Web Stack</h2>
                <p class="block-text">
                    Since my main goal was to gain more hands-on experience with React, it was the natural choice.  I also made sense since the cards, layouts, buttons, and frames would be better as reusable components, and managing state for what card and components were displayed would be easier as well.
                </p>
                <p class="block-text">
                    I really wanted to work with Tailwind on this project, and with my experience with Bootstrap it was easy to just jump in.  I didn't want to have to manage CSS files and class names, and Tailwind made styling less stressful while adding the benefits of a design system.
                </p>
                <p class="block-text">
                    Vite allowed for fast and easy scaffolding, with straght-forward configuration of Tailwind and PostCSS.  Deploying the app with Netlify was intuitive relatively frictionless - I had trouble deploying from GitHub with the CLI, but no problems doing so from the GUI.
